            <p>For starters, it is useful to familiarize yourself
with the use of a piano keyboard. Suppose you are sitting at a piano and do not
know a single note. Here's what you see:</p>
            <img src="tutorials_img/1st_tut/keyboard_88full.jpg" class="tutorial_img">
            <p>The keyboard consists of black and
white keys, and black are arranged in groups of two and three, or, we can say,
pairs and triples. This grouping makes it easier to find any desired note. For
example, the nearest white key to the left of a pair of black keys is <i>do</i>, or, using the letters of the Latin
alphabet, <i>C</i>. If you move from C in
the order of the Latin alphabet, the nearest white key to the left of the
triplet of black, is indicated by the letter F (or <i>fa</i>). All notes can be indicated in double: letters of the Latin
alphabet or names <i>do, re, mi, fa,</i>
etc. The illustration below shows the correspondence of the names of notes and
their Latin notation:</p>
            <img src="tutorials_img/1st_tut/2-octave-piano-keys.jpg" class="tutorial_img">
            <p>On the standard keyboard 8 notes <i>do</i> (C). The note C in the centre of the keyboard, or the fourth on
the left, is called &quot;C of the first octave / middle C&quot;. Although the
piano keyboard looks very large, in fact it consists of several repetitions of
the same group of notes. Five different black and seven different white keys
are those twelve tones based on which in music for centuries the melodies and
harmonies of all those symphonies and songs that you just heard were composed.</p>

            <section class="task_tutorials">
                <p><b>Task 1:</b> If you are
in front of instrument now, try playing all twelve notes, starting from <i>do</i> (C) of the first octave, moving from
left to right or vice versa.</p>
            </section>

            <p>You'll notice that the sound of the white keys is no
different from the sound of the black ones: if you close your eyes and try to
distinguish sound by pressing a white key or a black one, you will hardly be
able to do it (of course, if you do not have an absolute hearing when you hear
exactly which one note play). The question arises: why do we need black and white
keys?</p>

            <p>There are two main reasons. First, if all the keys
were white, then the keyboard would be half wider. Black keys are so inserted
between the white ones that essentially do not take up space. Imagine only that
you need to try to put a piano that has 88 only white keys (which is a standard
number of keys) of the usual width, into your room! Even if your room is
spacious enough for this, try to imagine how you would play it without a chair
with wheels. Secondly, thanks to space-saving black keys, it is possible to
play one octave, or the distance from one <i>do</i>
(C) to another, or from one <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>re</i> (D) to
another. The octave interval is very important, because it can double any <span class=GramE>particular sound</span>.
                Having learned to play melodies with
different fingers of the right hand, you can find it more interesting in some
places to play them in an octave.</p>

            <section class="task_tutorials">
                <p><b>Task 2:</b> All you
need to know now is the white key designation: <i>do</i> (C),<i> re</i> (D), <i>mi</i> (E), etc. Press any keys and try to
name them. You will be surprised how soon you will do it without the slightest
difficulty.</p>
                </section>

            <p>Now let's define the names for the black keys:</p>

            <p>Their name is formed from the whites closest to them.
The first black key on which the arrow points is between the notes <i>do</i>(C) and <i>re</i>(D) and can be called in two ways: <i>do-diesis</i>(C#) and <i>re-<span
                        class=SpellE>bemolle</span></i>(Db).</p>

            <p>The <i>sharp</i>/#/<i>diesis</i> indicates the note's pitch is
increased by a half-ton, and the <i>flat</i>/b/<span class=SpellE><i>bemolle</i></span> is
correspondingly a half-tone sound reduction. Thus, the difference between the
notes <i>do</i>(C) and <i>re</i>(D) is a tone. More about this we will talk in the next lessons.</p>

            <p>The second arrow indicates the <i>re-<span class=GramE>diesis<span style='font-style:normal'>(</span></span></i>D
#)/<i>mi-<span class=SpellE>bemolle</span></i>(<span class=SpellE>Eb</span>) key, etc.</p>

            <div class="task_tutorials">
                <p><b>Task 3:</b> Give the name to the black keys yourself and check the correctness of your judgments
    according to the picture.</p>
            </div>

            <p>For the sake of simplicity, the system of denotation of notes will be used only in Latin letters, so we advise you to get acquainted with it closer.</p>
